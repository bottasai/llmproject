"Oh my god, you almost have to laugh at how a communications business is so bad at internal communication. After an upgrade a tech expert came and messed up wiring and left with broadband not working. Engineers failed to turn up on two occasions despite promising time slots. Call centre staff are nice but not empowered so just apologise and can’t actually speak to any colleagues. Just hours of wasted time for customers and BT staff going round in circles. Absolute shambles."
"I would very much appreciate some practical advice.  I've signed up for Vodafone fibre broadband. Installation due 14th March.  Open reach visited and said too difficult. Wayleave signed, 40 days after still no action.  Luckily saw a technician who explained complicated connection could take weeks.  I'm left in an area with poor phone connection so I can't use my card machine so I'm losing sales.  Open reach suggests getting copperwire connection running but Vodafone say they can't do that and searches just seem to give fibre options.  Any suggestions who I go to for copper connection or any kind of useful support? Vodafone have sent me a dongle which is not connecting to the Internet."
"BT are the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Their lack of internal communication is quite shocking. It seems to take one team weeks to get an answer from another internal team. Despite signing up for a dedicated line (which the pricepoint would indicate to be a premium service) we get fobbed off at every stage. I will now actively advise anyone I encounter to AVOID BT at all costs. I will also be taking our other contracted services to other suppliers as soon as they are up for renewal. If you take one piece of advice today, it would be to go elsewhere. Do not use BT if you would like a workable service."
"I have fibre to the property but speed is from time to time a big issue. Rebooting their equipment several times doesn't work. Reported fault and engineer  visit to the home arranged. I waited 4.5 hours but they didn't turn up - no communication. Upon complaining they said they'd assessed the connection remotely and found no issue, but if that was correct, and given its an intermitent fault they should still communicate. So they arranged another home call out and again didn't turn up. They claim they found issues but fixed them externally. Again though I'm left waiting for 3 hours with no communication. Just don't trust them. I've asked for transcripts of complaints and evidence of what they did - looks like they're refusing to supply this. I will now find a local supplier as many neighbours have done. They were foisted on me by Openreach and that gives them a near monopoly position. If I could score zero then that's what I'd do."
"Thank you to Katherine in Blackburn!! 'Kindred spirit' older person, who I contacted at 8am this morning and 47 minutes later thought I had got some progress.This is after 6 weeks of absolute Hell!!I am 70 and very savvy. Family members are in their late 80s n 90s. BT please take this into consideration!! Instead of texting/writing/facebook /twitter, actually SPEAK to people about the things you are doing. I would be happy to speak to someone about this"
"Already off to a poor start. Initially, they said I couldn’t set up services at my address bc the last tenant did not transfer services. Called one hour later and they informed me that I could set up services. The CSR told me that I could have services by May 10th. So I signed the contract. Today, I got a text saying they would need to send an engineer to the property and the earliest date would be May 24."
