Upon complaining they said they'd assessed the connection remotely and found no issue, but if that was correct, and given its an intermitent fault they should still communicate. So they arranged another home call out and again didn't turn up. They claim they found issues but fixed them externally. Again though I'm left waiting for 3 hours with no communication. Just don't trust them. I've asked for transcripts of complaints and evidence of what they did - looks like they're refusing to supply this. I will now find a local supplier as many neighbours have done. They were foisted on me by Openreach and that gives them a near monopoly position.

I'm then transferred to another person to set up the new order only he tells me the best price they can do is £34pm with no gift card. Never been messed around so much!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"1"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/bt.com/64529bb11c7491460db4f163","itemReviewed":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/bt.com"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Harrison Mills","url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5fae68273e65b100190b53b6/"},"datePublished":"2023-05-03T19:36:49.000Z","headline":"1 Star for BT, 5 Stars for Customer Service","reviewBody":"1 star for the ridiculous price hikes and bully-boy tactics by charging an exorbitant amount to cancel so you're forced to pay.5 Stars for the lovely gentleman called Alan Ward that I spoke with today. Personable, understanding and although we couldn't come to the resolution I wanted he couldn't have been a nicer bloke about it all.Employ more people like Alan, but something does need to be done about these T&C's. Being able to increase people's direct debits by such a large amount and not even offering them the chance to cancel with minimal to no fee is borderline criminal.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"2"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1"},"inLanguage":"en"},{"@type":"Review","@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/bt.com/64536cd5b42cfb461d4a2f0b","itemReviewed":{"@id":"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/bt.com"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Paul Hodder","url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5b4cb82d4de5666d34059e19/"},"datePublished":"2023-05-04T10:29:09.000Z","headline":"Bad service","reviewBody":"Have been told fibre available at 29.99 per monthand had an engineer fit all the equipment and my copper line stopped.

BT are not my ISP, but their cables and engineers are used to supply my internet, and their laziness and incompetence caused severe distraction to my service. Clear now BT?  Christ…I am not a direct customer of BT, but they are still the issue. I am with a third party internet provider that uses their lines. For 6 months I have had utterly garbage service. No connection, drops every twenty minutes. Horrible performance all around.engineer after engineer has been sent. No one does a damn thing. I finally found the fault myself. The telegraph pole that feeds my building had its main cable spliced, and whoever did it not only did a terrible job, but they then never closed the seal properly. The pair of wires that supply my signal literally fell apart when examined. Crumbled to rust. Now they have been replace and the connection made weather proof, my internet is perfect. 6 months of screaming at NOW TV and it was BTs incompetence all along. I should have guessed. You are a relic from another time.

After an upgrade a tech expert came and messed up wiring and left with broadband not working. Engineers failed to turn up on two occasions despite promising time slots. Call centre staff are nice but not empowered so just apologise and can’t actually speak to any colleagues. Just hours of wasted time for customers and BT staff going round in circles.

typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-text-typography="true">I have hired BT Internet in December 2022, as it was very slow I have upgraded to Superfast Broadband one month ago. They had to send an Engineer once per month because the internet stops working many times per day. I have recently called them to report the same issue however they don’t call me back as it says on the SMS they sent me. Avoid BT!, not a serious company at all, I am an extremely disappointed client. You will suffer the consequences when I have to renew my contract.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography="true"><b class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_weight-heavy__E1LTj" weight="heavy">Date of experience<!-- -->:</b> <!-- -->May 06, 2023</p></div></section></article></div><div class="styles_cardWrapper__LcCPA styles_show__HUXRb styles_reviewCard__9HxJJ"><article class="paper_paper__1PY90 paper_outline__lwsUX card_card__lQWDv styles_reviewCard__hcAvl " data-service-review-card-paper="true"><aside class="styles_consumerInfoWrapper__KP3Ra" aria-label="Info for Jennifer Sanders"><div class="styles_consumerDetailsWrapper__p2wdr"><div class="avatar_avatar__hmBp6 avatar_yellow__p_g1i" style="width:44px;min-width:44px;height:44px;min-height:44px" data-consumer-avatar="true"><span class="typography_heading-xs__jSwUz typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_disableResponsiveSizing__OuNP7 avatar_avatarName__ehkAr">JS</span></div><a href="/users/5facf4bdbdde17001afc7741" rel="nofollow" name="consumer-profile" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 link_wrapper__5ZJEx styles_consumerDetails__ZFieb" data-consumer-profile-link="true"><span class="typography_heading-xxs__QKBS8 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-consumer-name-typography="true">Jennifer Sanders</span><div class="styles_consumerExtraDetails__fxS4S" data-consumer-reviews-count="8"><span class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l" data-consumer-reviews-count-typography="true">8<!-- --> reviews</span><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_detailsIcon__Fo_ua" data-consumer-country-typography="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentColor" class="icon_icon__ECGRl" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14px" height="14px"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M3.404 1.904A6.5 6.5 0 0 1 14.5 6.5v.01c0 .194 0 .396-.029.627l-.004.03-.023.095c-.267 2.493-1.844 4.601-3.293 6.056a18.723 18.723 0 0 1-2.634 2.19 11.015 11.015 0 0 1-.234.154l-.013.01-.004.002h-.002L8 15.25l-.261.426h-.002l-.004-.003-.014-.009a13.842 13.842 0 0 1-.233-.152 18.388 18.388 0 0 1-2.64-2.178c-1.46-1.46-3.05-3.587-3.318-6.132l-.003-.026v-.068c-.025-.2-.025-.414-.025-.591V6.5a6.5 6.5 0 0 1 1.904-4.596ZM8 15.25l-.261.427.263.16.262-.162L8 15.25Zm-.002-.598a17.736 17.736 0 0 0 2.444-2.04c1.4-1.405 2.79-3.322 3.01-5.488l.004-.035.026-.105c.018-.153.018-.293.018-.484a5.5 5.5 0 0 0-11 0c0 .21.001.371.02.504l.005.035v.084c.24 2.195 1.632 4.109 3.029 5.505a17.389 17.389 0 0 0 2.444 2.024Z"/><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M8 4a2.5 2.5 0 1 0 0 5 2.5 2.5 0 0 0 0-5ZM4.5 6.5a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 7 0 3.5 3.5 0 0 1-7 0Z"/></svg><span>GB</span></div></div></a></div></aside><hr class="divider_divider__M85e9 styles_cardDivider__42s_0 divider_appearance-subtle__DkHcP"/><section class="styles_reviewContentwrapper__zH_9M" aria-disabled="false"><div class="styles_reviewHeader__iU9Px" data-service-review-rating="1"><div class="star-rating_starRating__4rrcf star-rating_medium__iN6Ty"><img alt="Rated 1 out of 5 stars" src="https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg"/></div><div class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_datesWrapper__RCEKH"><time dateTime="2023-05-06T15:02:48.000Z" class="" data-service-review-date-time-ago="true">17 hours ago</time></div></div><div class="styles_reviewContent__0Q2Tg" aria-hidden="false" data-review-content="true"><a href="/reviews/64564ff88322b6ab00b4d9d6" rel="nofollow" target="_self" class="link_internal__7XN06 typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-inherit__TlgPO link_link__IZzHN link_notUnderlined__szqki" data-review-title-typography="true"><h2 class="typography_heading-s__f7029 typography_appearance-default__AAY17" data-service-review-title-typography="true">I would very much appreciate some…</h2></a><p class="typography_body-l__KUYFJ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-text-typography="true">I would very much appreciate some practical advice.  I&#x27;ve signed up for Vodafone fibre broadband. Installation due 14th March.  Open reach visited and said too difficult. Wayleave signed, 40 days after still no action.  Luckily saw a technician who explained complicated connection could take weeks.  I&#x27;m left in an area with poor phone connection so I can&#x27;t use my card machine so I&#x27;m losing sales.  Open reach suggests getting copperwire connection running but Vodafone say they can&#x27;t do that and searches just seem to give fibre options.  Any suggestions who I go to for copper connection or any kind of useful support? Vodafone have sent me a dongle which is not connecting to the Internet.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn"

Their lack of internal communication is quite shocking. It seems to take one team weeks to get an answer from another internal team. Despite signing up for a dedicated line (which the pricepoint would indicate to be a premium service) we get fobbed off at every stage. I will now actively advise anyone I encounter to AVOID BT at all costs. I will also be taking our other contracted services to other suppliers as soon as they are up for renewal. <br/><br/>If you take one piece of advice today, it would be to go elsewhere. Do not use BT if you would like a workable service.</p><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_color-black__5LYEn" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography="true"><b class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_weight-heavy__E1LTj" weight="heavy">Date of experience<!-- -->:</b> <!-- -->May 05, 2023</p></div></section><div class="paper_paper__1PY90 paper_outline__lwsUX paper_subtle__lwJpX card_card__lQWDv card_noPadding__D8PcU styles_wrapper__ib2L5"><div class="styles_iconWrapper__demic"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="inherit" class="icon_icon__ECGRl icon_appearance-subtle__9l3Sf" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16px" height="16px"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M8.36 1.528v3.48c3.46.124 5.38 1.531 6.403 3.316 1.04 1.817 1.097 3.938 1.097 5.176v1.914l-.936-1.67c-1.048-1.869-2.15-2.778-3.278-3.24-1.012-.415-2.09-.49-3.286-.502v3.47L0 7.5l8.36-5.972ZM8.024 6H7.36V3.472L1.72 7.5l5.64 4.028V9h.5c1.384 0 2.808.023 4.165.578.977.4 1.893 1.064 2.747 2.135-.109-.942-.35-1.97-.877-2.891C13.042 7.332 11.387 6.04 8.024 6Z"/></svg></div><div class="styles_content__Hl2Mi"><div class="styles_replyInfo__FYSje"><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 typography_weight-heavy__E1LTj styles_replyCompany__ro_yX" data-service-review-business-reply-title-typography="true" weight="heavy">Reply from BT</p><time dateTime="2023-05-06T12:31:54.000Z" class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-subtle__8_H2l styles_replyDate__Iem0_" data-service-review-business-reply-date-time-ago="true">19 hours ago</time></div><p class="typography_body-m__xgxZ_ typography_appearance-default__AAY17 styles_message__shHhX" data-service-review-business-reply-text-typography="true">Good afternoon, Rebecca.

Rebooting their equipment several times doesn&#x27;t work. Reported fault and engineer  visit to the home arranged. I waited 4.5 hours but they didn&#x27;t turn up - no communication. Upon complaining they said they&#x27;d assessed the connection remotely and found no issue, but if that was correct, and given its an intermitent fault they should still communicate. So they arranged another home call out and again didn&#x27;t turn up. They claim they found issues but fixed them externally. Again though I&#x27;m left waiting for 3 hours with no communication. Just don&#x27;t trust them. I&#x27;ve asked for transcripts of complaints and evidence of what they did - looks like they&#x27;re refusing to supply this. I will now find a local supplier as many neighbours have done. They were foisted on me by Openreach and that gives them a near monopoly position.

Came to the end of my contract so used uswitch to change to a lower price of £26pm from sky broadband. Bt rang me to ask why I was leaving and offered me £25pm and an m&amp;s gift card which I agreed to accept and cancelled the sky order within the cool off period. After receiving no correspondence I get charged £40 for the next month&#x27;s broadband!! So I ring BT and they say that the order is stuck and won&#x27;t go through so they will cancel it and put it through again. I&#x27;m then transferred to another person to set up the new order only he tells me the best price they can do is £34pm with no gift card.

BT are not my ISP, but their cables and engineers are used to supply my internet, and their laziness and incompetence caused severe distraction to my service. Clear now BT?  Christ…<br/><br/>I am not a direct customer of BT, but they are still the issue. I am with a third party internet provider that uses their lines. <br/>For 6 months I have had utterly garbage service. No connection, drops every twenty minutes. Horrible performance all around.engineer after engineer has been sent. No one does a damn thing. <br/>I finally found the fault myself. The telegraph pole that feeds my building had its main cable spliced, and whoever did it not only did a terrible job, but they then never closed the seal properly. The pair of wires that supply my signal literally fell apart when examined. Crumbled to rust. <br/>Now they have been replace and the connection made weather proof, my internet is perfect. <br/>6 months of screaming at NOW TV and it was BTs incompetence all along. <br/>I should have guessed. You are a relic from another time.
