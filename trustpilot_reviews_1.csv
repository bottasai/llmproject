Review
"Oh my god, you almost have to laugh at how a communications business is so bad at internal communication. After an upgrade a tech expert came and messed up wiring and left with broadband not working. Engineers failed to turn up on two occasions despite promising time slots. Call centre staff are nice but not empowered so just apologise and can’t actually speak to any colleagues. Just hours of wasted time for customers and BT staff going round in circles. Absolute shambles."
"I have hired BT Internet in December 2022, as it was very slow I have upgraded to Superfast Broadband one month ago. They had to send an Engineer once per month because the internet stops working many times per day. I have recently called them to report the same issue however they don’t call me back as it says on the SMS they sent me. Avoid BT!, not a serious company at all, I am an extremely disappointed client. You will suffer the consequences when I have to renew my contract."
"I would very much appreciate some practical advice.  I've signed up for Vodafone fibre broadband. Installation due 14th March.  Open reach visited and said too difficult. Wayleave signed, 40 days after still no action.  Luckily saw a technician who explained complicated connection could take weeks.  I'm left in an area with poor phone connection so I can't use my card machine so I'm losing sales.  Open reach suggests getting copperwire connection running but Vodafone say they can't do that and searches just seem to give fibre options.  Any suggestions who I go to for copper connection or any kind of useful support? Vodafone have sent me a dongle which is not connecting to the Internet."
Just had Full Fibre fitted after having normal fibre from BT for many years. Result is I now have no WI-FI signal in most of my small bungalow but have a very fast signal in 1 room only.Complained to BT whose response was simply close the complaint without even bothering to reply.At no point during the ordering or selling process did BT attempt to explain that they can not place the Full Fibre router centrally as it seams the cable isn’t flexible enough to run around the walls indoors as a normal cable would.Do not order full fibre unless you are prepared to pay substantially more than quoted for their extra WI-FI disks. Total rip off
"Two months to sort out moving broadband and phone line around a house move.Over 15 hours spent on the phone to BT.Over 20 BT advisors spoken to.Four separate home hubs received along with numerous other boxes - in addition to existing home hub.Daughter doing a levels, newborn baby and two adults trying to work from home.Eventually an Openreach engineer is sent out yeseterday but arrived before BT had notified us of the visit. So yet another order cancelled / failed and being told I have to put through what must be at least a fifth order Does anyone at BT care at all?"
"BT are the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Their lack of internal communication is quite shocking. It seems to take one team weeks to get an answer from another internal team. Despite signing up for a dedicated line (which the pricepoint would indicate to be a premium service) we get fobbed off at every stage. I will now actively advise anyone I encounter to AVOID BT at all costs. I will also be taking our other contracted services to other suppliers as soon as they are up for renewal. If you take one piece of advice today, it would be to go elsewhere. Do not use BT if you would like a workable service."
"I have fibre to the property but speed is from time to time a big issue. Rebooting their equipment several times doesn't work. Reported fault and engineer  visit to the home arranged. I waited 4.5 hours but they didn't turn up - no communication. Upon complaining they said they'd assessed the connection remotely and found no issue, but if that was correct, and given its an intermitent fault they should still communicate. So they arranged another home call out and again didn't turn up. They claim they found issues but fixed them externally. Again though I'm left waiting for 3 hours with no communication. Just don't trust them. I've asked for transcripts of complaints and evidence of what they did - looks like they're refusing to supply this. I will now find a local supplier as many neighbours have done. They were foisted on me by Openreach and that gives them a near monopoly position. If I could score zero then that's what I'd do."
"Thank you to Katherine in Blackburn!! 'Kindred spirit' older person, who I contacted at 8am this morning and 47 minutes later thought I had got some progress.This is after 6 weeks of absolute Hell!!I am 70 and very savvy. Family members are in their late 80s n 90s. BT please take this into consideration!! Instead of texting/writing/facebook /twitter, actually SPEAK to people about the things you are doing. I would be happy to speak to someone about this"
"Already off to a poor start. Initially, they said I couldn’t set up services at my address bc the last tenant did not transfer services. Called one hour later and they informed me that I could set up services. The CSR told me that I could have services by May 10th. So I signed the contract. Today, I got a text saying they would need to send an engineer to the property and the earliest date would be May 24."
It does not surprise me that BT has a Trust Pilot score of 2.5 stars.I have been with BT for a number of years and recently my bill has gone up by 15%.  Despite them saying an email was sent I have received nothing and because I am tied in they aren't interested.  My bill is now almost £50 a month and they are offering new customers £29.99 a month for faster broadband than mine!  No loyalty was offered and no support.  Disgusting response from BT
Absolutely appalling service from BT. Came to the end of my contract so used uswitch to change to a lower price of £26pm from sky broadband. Bt rang me to ask why I was leaving and offered me £25pm and an m&s gift card which I agreed to accept and cancelled the sky order within the cool off period. After receiving no correspondence I get charged £40 for the next month's broadband!! So I ring BT and they say that the order is stuck and won't go through so they will cancel it and put it through again. I'm then transferred to another person to set up the new order only he tells me the best price they can do is £34pm with no gift card. Never been messed around so much!
"1 star for the ridiculous price hikes and bully-boy tactics by charging an exorbitant amount to cancel so you're forced to pay.5 Stars for the lovely gentleman called Alan Ward that I spoke with today. Personable, understanding and although we couldn't come to the resolution I wanted he couldn't have been a nicer bloke about it all.Employ more people like Alan, but something does need to be done about these T&C's. Being able to increase people's direct debits by such a large amount and not even offering them the chance to cancel with minimal to no fee is borderline criminal."
"Have been told fibre available at 29.99 per monthand had an engineer fit all the equipment and my copper line stopped. After yet another engineers visit nothing works. I've been sent a hub but its not fibre and to cap it all I'm told this morning my next bill will be approx 55 pounds. I've been a customer with BT countless years and this is how they treat me, I'm 72 years old. Totally disgusted!!!"
"EDIT for clarity, as English is too much for BT. BT are not my ISP, but their cables and engineers are used to supply my internet, and their laziness and incompetence caused severe distraction to my service. Clear now BT?  Christ…I am not a direct customer of BT, but they are still the issue. I am with a third party internet provider that uses their lines. For 6 months I have had utterly garbage service. No connection, drops every twenty minutes. Horrible performance all around.engineer after engineer has been sent. No one does a damn thing. I finally found the fault myself. The telegraph pole that feeds my building had its main cable spliced, and whoever did it not only did a terrible job, but they then never closed the seal properly. The pair of wires that supply my signal literally fell apart when examined. Crumbled to rust. Now they have been replace and the connection made weather proof, my internet is perfect. 6 months of screaming at NOW TV and it was BTs incompetence all along. I should have guessed. You are a relic from another time. Just roll over and die."
BT can only dream of being completely useless. Useless would be a major improvement for them.Engineers don't turn up for booked appointments and go home when there's no-one home -when you've told them you'll be out. It's difficult to see how their service could be any worse
I don't know why so many bad reviews I have been with BT 3 years I pay £20 for 50meg and 24/7 free callsBT has been very reliable better than Sky or virginSky I had outages every 2 weeks last outage lasted 2 and half days no BB and phone no compensationvirgin good speed terrible customer service and billing I could never work out my billI had an bt outage in the area 1st time in 2 years done a line test 5 pm bt automatically booked an engineer visit next day 8amEngineer ran test no faults all goodI get 50meg max the line can handle but other isp give you 35meg  and charge a lot more money
"DO NOT ENTER A CONTRACT WITH THIS COMPANY FOR BROADBAND OR BT SPORT!!  Horrendous customer care, even when they admit that the picture quality is not as it should be on BT sport, they still refuse to let you out a contract despite self admitting the product is of a lesser standard than it should be. Absolutely perplexed by their complaints procedures and how they close them when THEY feel they have done all they can. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!"
"I pay my BT internet and phone by direct debit, My march bill was £70.99, April Bill £87.99. the only reason I have the the land line is for the internet I don't use it for making phone calls, they informed me that their increase based on inflation at 14,per cent , this is obviously not based rpi. I inquired about terminating my contract and was it would be £921, to terminate my contract, as a 75yr old pensioner on a fixed income I am now tied to this unreasonably Priced Contract until 4/10/2024 the fact that a customer for the last 40,yrs or so means nothing them"
If this is the standard of a British company then we are all screwed. After waiting 9 months for a fibre appointment BT are yet again a no show 6 previous visits abd nothing got resolved but funnily enough they started billing us for an upgraded service we don’t have no surprises there then. Do not use their internet if you can they cannot be trusted abs put more effort into striking than customer service.
I rang up customer services to renew my contract and was confronted by the most disagreeable and rude person I have had the displeasure of talking to in a long time. Also he lied and talked over me! They are also expensive and don't seem to want to keep old customers. Would never recommend them to anybody. Absolutely awful company. 😡😡😡😡😡
Please stay away from BT I was taking my Broadband to another company when they called to get me to stay with them they gave me an offer for 24 months I asked the person that called that was that price for 24 months or would it go up they informed that it was for the full 24 months then in May the price went up when I called in they didn't care and told me that the price has gone up and I need to pay this. So don't believe anything they say and don't use them
"just got my recent bill £15 more than last month apparently 15% increase but extra 10% for previous month  . Well my contract is up for review in August and i will be changing, Unjustified increase"
"Unless you get benefits you can't have access to cheaper broadband deals.Renewing my contract in November I think not.This country is screwed, along with all people in WORK, PEOPLE ARE DEFINATELY BETTER OF ON BENEFITS."
"After 7 attempts to upgrade my home to full fibre - their system kept crashing while creating the order - which i had to alert them to wasting around 25 hours on the phone to them. They eventually said i would have to goto another provider and they would waive any charges. I phoned to advise them that this was the instruction they had given me, they then tried to charge me. I advised them they had already told me no costs. So they put me on hold and removed my phone service there and then. Phoned me on the mobile to tell me they have removed my service at my request!! When it was broadband i was leaving them for. I'll never go back to BT."
"I switched over to try BT again as TalkTalk were ripping me off, but I got an email saying it will take even longer to transfer the service over. I now have to wait over 2 weeks! It never used to take this long. Now I have to pay a higher rate with my previous supplier until the takeover. Is this tactical to get more money out of you? There is no installation required as I already have a working up to date line. I don't understand how it takes so long to transfer over. Not a good start BT!"
BT is Robbers Robbers RobbersUpdated my contract behind me. They can’t send my that contract already 7 days because they don’t have it. And BT don’t want cancel my contract.BT stealing my money from my bank account.BT is Robbers
"I was called by someone from EE promising me (i) EE/BT combined broadband coverage (ii) Broadband in every room in my home. After inquiring from BT if this was the case, it turns out it wasnt true. I spoke to more than 4 different people, all of whom I had to recap the whole situation. I was promised a call back from some manager that never called. I called to cancel as what I was promised isnt what was being delivered. I was told I would pay for a service that I am not using. The person I spoke to was incredibly rude and unprofessional. I have no idea how this company still functions given the incompetence on display. I bet the executive have a nice bonus though."
"What has been a standard home move with the new home being an ex BT customer has led to shambolic customer services from BT. I tried to move our contract with BT to our new address and was told, yes, all fine, there is fibre in your new area and it should be a straightforward swap. 10 hours later with BT on numerous phone calls, they now tell me there is no fibre in my new area, and they have to cancel down my order which takes 24h to replace an order for copper broadband.In an era of WFH, this is absolutely shocking customer services - surely people move home all the time and it should not be this difficult!"
"Glad the IGNORANT B****** Engineer let me down this morning now WITH NO COMMON DECENCY to let me know because it gave me the heads up at how rank they are.  Ironic that they deal in communications but are COMPLETELY USELESS at COMMUNICATING.  Enjoy collecting your equipment, I won’t be making any trips to the post office to return it."
"The website in terms of customer support it woeful-  takes ages to find what you require and no facility to cancel anything on line, no webchat facility and no way of emailing them - IT's 2023!!So you have to call - 20 minutes on hold, then up to an hour to resolve nothing! They wanted my DD to increase to £129 from £75 so I cancelled BT Sport to try an get this down - for a quarterly bill/monthly payer, they bill in advance, so the £180 on my bill would no longer include the £78 they wanted for BT Sport, but get this, they can't rebill me!????? And reset the DD accordingly? What??? Or can they reset the DD based on this - WTAF?So I am expected to pay well over the usage costs for 3 months, and then be in credit? Well sorry I'd like that money in my pocket, not theirs, unless they would use it for improving their systems and web site.Change of Broadband Provider incoming"
"BT your service  appalling installation of new broadband & telephone, phone working broadband not working.  Openreach engineer installed and left staying all working on his side.  Waited 5 days for BT engineer who attended and said nothing internal need an Openreach engineer.   You can see where this is going, stuck in a loop with no working broadband.  When are you getting this service working? Where is my compensation?"
"Appalling service from BT. Was on standard fibre broadband,  had full fibre installed last Monday,  external fault 3 days later. This company have no concept of customer service or the reliance on people to be able to work on a stable service.  Fortunately I am within my 14 days of subscribing to the service, I will be cancelling my contract. I don't use Facebook or twitter so no point sending me there to be further fobbed off as everyone in your company are currently doing.Been with BT over 25 years,  service is now dire,  fortunately plenty others out there who will value my custom."
"Had BT Full fibre fitted yesterday. Less than 24 hours later system breaks down due to an apparent external fault. No engineer available until next Friday. Want me to pay £8 a month extra for halo system to provide me with a service that they have a contracted obligation to provide me with. However, this can't be delivered until next Wednesday. Asked to speak to a manager, need to wait up to 72 hours. You couldn't make it up."
"Purchased BT Broadband 18month contract through EE 23months ago. When contract expired 5 months ago I contacted EE in Dec 22(who bills me) Was misinformed regarding changeover process. Changed to Vodaphone but was still being billed by BT Feb 23! Spoke to EE, told me I was misinformed, they have cancelled BT broadband & refunded DD’s that were taken. April 23 - termination letter and outstanding bill from BT arrived. Spoke to 3 different BT sales advisors, one practically called me a liar. An hour on the phone for someone to tell me the account has now been closed and nothing outstanding. When I asked what if I get another letter from BT she said just use the appeals process! Totally incompetent staff at EE & BT (part of same group) complete jokeUPDATE - received an email stating my broadband will be cancelled 01/06/23 and there will be a £55 charge! I despair!"
"Last month I rang BT to cancel my broadband and landline service as I was having Fibre installed through another company. The cancellation date 28 days ahead was given. After the call I received an email stating that ALL my services including BT Mobile were being cancelled. I phoned back and confirmed that I wanted to keep my mobile phone (that has nothing to do with a new broadband installation). They confirmed the mobile would continue. A few days later I had an issue with the broadband and rang to confirm that it was still connected. Whilst on the phone I checked again that the mobile would remain on. At this point they transferred me to BT Mobile who confirmed that it would remain. Today, the cancellation date, my broadband, landline AND MOBILE were turned off. BT have no live chat option so I had to go into an EE store to borrow their phone to ring BT. As they were apparently trying to get it reconnected they hung up on me. I rang back and spoke to my 7th different BT staff member who, like the others, treated it as a brand new request. He said he would send a message to someone to get it reconnected. My phone still doesn’t work. The staff were friendly but I would take a rude, competent person over a friendly incompetent one any day. An absolute shambles."
"Disappointing is a word that is extremally soft word to use when describing my experience with BT.I've been with BT for 14 years now and whilst it's been ok, the service has just gotten worse and worse over the years.Rising prices all the timeRenew contract without telling me then notify me that if i want to cancel, i have to pay £200Internet speed is always dipping to the lowest guaranteed value ( Sometimes lower )Very difficult to get hold of someone for helpLuckily my contract runs out in 40 days and I've notified them I'm leaving and never coming back.Such a shame it's gone down hill so much."
Why do BT facilitate scammers to blight the lives of the general public. Surely they should check the credentials of these companies. 01618435946 is today’s scam caller. Sort it out
Worst experience I’ve ever had !After a month of working on proposals we eventually made a deal !I asked for proposal in writing I read all 59 pages !I rant to say I was happy they said they’d send a docu sign !I signed it !But it turned out it was nothing like the proposal it had different sites and amounts on it !Then they cut all my business off for a week whilst transferring and yiu couldn’t speak to anyone !Horrendous still suffering slow speed and failures daily !
"Unfortunately I had trouble with the return of my kit. I returned it at the end of February but it had not been processed. BT we're threatening me with recovery action (threaten is a strong word, I understand that if a bill isn't paid then it will eventually need to go to a debt collector). In fairness they were not harassing me and gave me a lot of time. I spoke with multiple agents with no luck on getting this sorted. Until I spoke with Lucy from Early Life (Dundee based agent) who was an absolute star and sorted the whole thing out for me. She has taken a weight off my shoulders and turned what would have been a 1 star review into a 5 star."
Charging £39+ for phone and 1MBS! Internet doesn’t work and the phone always has connection issues. Wouldn’t recommend
"Shocking! Our business landline is down so we contacted Plusnet, who offered us a temporary call divert until a BT Openworld engineer rectifies the problem, which is estimated as being midnight on Thursday! This was offered for free given customers contact us by phone to book... However, we tested the call divert and it didn't work! Rang Plusnet back and spoke to someone who really didn't understand the problem - they said it would cost us £22.50! THEN advised it had been declined because we are moving provider in two weeks!!! FUMING! Absolutely no empathy, no understanding, no support and NO SOLUTION! Just told we need to contact our insurance company!We are a small family run restaurant who have struggled through covid and the current cost of living crisis, and we will loose a lot of business this week because Plusnet and BT Openworld aren't willing to understand this situation and how it affects us.ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!"
"So my Internet went down on Sunday, the first day they can look at it is Wednesday. This means I cannot watch Internet TV, work from home etc. So best case scenario if they fix it, I lost Internet on 4 days, had to travel to work and spend the bank holiday weekend with no Internet. Their compensation - NOTHING. Because it is fixed in 2 working days, it doesn't matter I haven't had the service I paid for for over half a week, they still expect full payment for this month.Even better, they can do this as many times as they like and offer you nothing in return.Oh and they closed my complaint without asking me.All in all I would say to avoid them and I've only been with them 2 weeks."
"Yet another company milking inflation to increase their prices. Increased their price by nearly 15%, shameful stuff. Will change supplier when my contracts up. Remember who ripped us off during this rampant inflation and hit them when it’s over!!A subsequent reply from them to contact their ""value team"" to get another deal entirely misses the point. Its impossible to trust them and they are fleecing us under the cover of inflation."
"Broadband down for a week and counting. BT runs a line test, nothing wrong must be a problem in the house.  Engineer one calls to the house 5 days after reporting fault. I waste a Saturday waiting for him, he arrives late runs a test and says nothing wrong in the house and needs another engineer to call who looks at stuff outside the house. Engineer two arrives 3 days later - rude bloke with zero social skills runs various tests says he will call me when repairs complete then calls round the house 4 hours later to say he can’t fix it and I have to ring BT to order new router. Meanwhile I have one very frustrated family and a bank account which has £250 out of it to pay office commuter costs. Zero service or interest from BT and god knows when I will get my broadband back. I thought virgin were poor but BT make them look exceptional. Avoid BT they have no clue about service, offer a fragmented product and have no empathy or understanding of their customers. Im a shareholder and I’m appalled."
"Terrible service, reduced my bill 2 months ago, agreed to keep all my BT package for a reduced monthly charge. Talktalk for the same package is a lot cheaper.However, BT have to charge the agreed price. I have had to spend time calling BT to get a refund. Where the Customer service personnel were rude and did not want to help. I asked to speak to a Manager but this was refused. My Advise don't choose BT if you want great prices, or good Customer service"
"I don't have words to express the contempt I have for BT's utterly useless service.Engineer arrives, leaves. Service falls over.Repeat, over, and over and over again. BT are beyond uselessIt's amazing that BT are far too stupid to understand that online forums are completely useless, of no value whatsoever - especially when your broadband is constantly failing."
"The engineer installing my full fibre broadband drilled through my heating pipe and flooded my lounge ruining my carpet and underlay causing water damage to floor, wall and skirting boards. I rang BT and different call centre staff have told me it isn’t their responsibility. They would not transfer me to a manager to sort this sorry episode out. I wish I had not agreed to change to full fibre."
"Can I give them -11? While we were on holiday in March they changed our broadband, but also decided I had cancelled my landline!! So we came back at the end of March to find we had no phone. Couldn't be reconnected until 24th April(6 weeks!!) Got a new router and told the phoneline would be 'Digital Voice Recognition!!). Numerous phone-calls, BT admitted it was their fault and they would pay some money back into my bank account!! RUBBISH. Still nothing- where do you complain (OFCOM). My in-laws are in their 80s n 90s & don't use mobiles!! Nobody can contact us."
"My bills just increased by £20 a month, yet no change in service.....  I'm lost, can't wait for my contract to end, will definitely be changing providers."
"Just moved over to BT from Vodafone, so far its been great, Bills have all been correct, friendly service. I actually get through to a British call center which is a God send when you have a Glasweigan accent lol. Also got a package deal where i get 3 cordless home telephones for free with 700 free mins to any phone anytime, Broadband has been on point too. So happy days. I had terrible experience with Vodafone so this is all good now."
"Renew a contract automaticly without say I need to pay 332 if I want to leave. My payment day is on 3rd each month, called to cancel on 2 May, being told I need to pay for May and Jun, plus the 332.  this is no zero star, otherwise I will give a zero instead of 1."
"Phoned BT as I need to cut my monthly bills. I am now paying £60 a month for fibre 300 with halo 3. I do not need that speed and asked if I could transfer to a cheaper contract even with less speed, they said no, absolutely no help at all and as my contract doesn’t finish till March 2024 I cannot cancel as it would cost me £224 penalty!! Can’t wait for my contract to finish so I can leave BT after being a loyal customer for many years. Never again, please be warned and avoid BT!!!!!"
"Joined as a new customer and was told no engineer needed to visit when I signed up. A few days later I was told an engineer would need to visit resulting in an unpaid day off work. The person arrived, and did their thing but still no broadband. Spent hours online to tech support and was told it was definitely a wiring issue that could be easily fixed so another engineer visit was arranged and I was 'guaranteed' the service would be up and running. During my second unpaid day off and the engineer cancelled. Another visit was arranged and another unpaid day off was booked. The engineer arrived, walked in, looked at it and said it was an Open Reach issue and left. Another visit was arranged and another unpaid day off was booked. No engineer arrived. When I called them they said I didn't need to be in any way, that advice was a 'mistake' and it wouldn't be fixed until the 6th. Their advice was, 'Sorry, we can cancel the contract'. A week later, four days off work and still no broadband. The only positive I can say is that they manage to make Virgin look half-decent.  If you are thinking of switching to BT, run as fast as you can whilst you still can."
Truly shocking service from BT. I was hoping they would be better than Vodafone but sadly there turning out to be far worse! luckily I am within the cancellation period.Had my broadband/landline switched over 3 days ago and I am still waiting for the landline to work!!!! Normally not so much of an issue but my elderly disabled mother relies on the landline and its causing her distress. Extremely unhappy and sad at the woeful experience I am having....time wasted on the phone etc.SHOCKING.......
"All suddenly I had no connection on Wednesday the 25th night with a no-stop flashing orange light on my hub. Because of the late time I had to wait the day after to contact someone. Result? A failure in the network or whatever it does means with an estimated fixing day on the 3rd of May.So irritated and annoyed I pushed and asked for more assistance or a way to get everything fixed way before but no, their answer was “Engineers don't work weekends in all areas. You'll be updated on 3rd.” I pay the triple of what I even supposed to, almost £50 for a low basic connection of 32 Mpbs, always had issues and drops of connection, and that’s not a priority case? You should keep your customers close instead of pushing them to leave. Utterly disgusted, irritated and annoyed."
"Offered me a package at a price 35% less than what I was paying, for a similar level of service, after I threatened to cancel. Weeks later they realised they made a mistake and continued to charge me at the higher price. Complaint sent to executive team who were unwilling to honour the original proposal made. Absolute charlatans, I'll be off as soon as I'm able."
Firstly do not reply please contact us via Facebook etc I have had terrible internet for over a year now and several engineers and open reach have been out and always told something different! Spoke many times and always had differing information given! Even the engineer advised me to fight my case and cancel as I am not getting the promised speed at all! it’s caused so much stress in our house where I got to the point to pay the fee and just cancel my contract otherwise going to lose my mental health with them! Spoke to 5 different advisers today 3 confirming they can see the drop and fault and 2 arguing it and saying they can’t see it and it’s good internet I got! Absolutely ridiculous! I can’t wait to never ever hear or see them again in my life! Terrible customer service! They have dragged it on for a year and still making excuses to fix it and still made me pay to cancel which explains what kind of a company they are! Looking forward to our new internet provider bye BT!
"So I lost my broadband connection at 22:15 on the 27th April. I've had phone calls with bt customer service and an engineer. I now have to wait 5 days before I can get engineer out to my property. I have to relocate my business. As I dont have a TV licence and cannot connect to the Internet, I don't have any entertainment. Please do not sign up to BT!!"
Despair.....switched over to BT on the 24th April and still no phone!Beggars belief. Numerous phone calls to no avail!!!!!BT...what is going on?Please do not reply saying contact via Facebook etc.How about you contact me?I'm truly shocked how BT can remain in business....Every time I ring I am told someone will ring me back...but no one does.Problem is even though I am within my 14 day cooling off period I cant even leave as they have to fix my issue before I can. Otherwise I run the risk of loosing my home number which my ELDERLY DISABLED Mother relies on.You have all my contact details and if smart enough (will not hold my breath) can contact me!
"I renewed the contract from April 2022 for 30 months at the price of 29.99. 13 months later, they increased the price 2 times and up to 37.74 due to inflation. I can't leave because of the contract whatever how much their price increased. Otherwise, it costs you 252.31 to break the contract. It is not a fair contract. Think before you choose BT. They are not kind to their existing customer but offer new customer 17.49 for 5 first months, then 34.99."
"Do all representatives that answer the calls work from home ???? It must be the worst company ever they fob you off from one person to another and do absolutely nothing , we moved house they had one one else on our account then when asked security questions they told us our bank payment was wrong when we had the statement in front of us !! Amelia you are one of the most ignorant people I have ever had to deal with and if you worked in my company you would have received your p45 . I don’t know if any directors or even managers read customers reviews but I suggest you do there are more and more broad band companies setting up all the time and I will raise a glass when yours goes under sorry but you don’t deserve peoples money invest in your work force and customer care first ."
If I could give 0 stars I would.Just can’t believe their absolute incompetence. And it’s every time we have any dealings with them.Just trying to get a second broadband line fitted to our offices and it’s taken weeks. Absolute chaos 5 engineer visits and still hasn’t been done for various reasons. We have been billed for it though even though we haven’t actually got it!
We changed broadband and phone to bt. The openreach engineer was very helpful. After they had connected us to their service we have been left to deal with it all ourselves. We are not young and would have appreciated some help setting it all up. The only thing we have gained is a fastish internet. The yealink phone they gave us is not as good as our old gigaset system. We had 5 phones but now just one that works. We have lost our voicemail and text messaging service and not gained anything. I am really sorry we fell for it. The phone is very disappointing.
Engineers cancelling at last minute. Disks that don't work. Useless internet. Abusive thuggish men working in their call centre.
"Tried to transfer my mobile numbers to ee, disaster from the start. Still paying for numbers on Bt and extra numbers on ee! Terrible service. Will no doubt have to spend hours on the phone to sort.AVOID."
"1st time hving broadband, tv and landline. Hvnt got set up yet but so far my experience with BT been 1st class. Great customer service and although delay getting equipment no problem getting engineer date moved."
"Bt without authorization and with a fully paid bill cut our broadband,moblie, and landline. after 33 emails and telephone calls spanning 9.5 hours-BT still can""t fix it . multiple conflicting stories by their reps go anywhere but bt. terrible service"
Had fibre broadband package for £15 month as I'm on Universal Credit. And had a recordable tv box with BT sport for £1 a month for 6 months absolute bargain! Fibre broadband on Universal Credit is £20 a month with Sky and they charge £28 a month for BT sport channels! Thanks BT I'll never have rip off Sky again 🙂
"I work very hard and look forward to weekends, especially longer bank-holiday weekends. I had arranged for me and my partner to spend the long weekend at our house and looked forward to watching our team play and had paid £11.95 for NowTV and then Netflix movies for the evening. BT have this knack of screwing things up and our the NowTV was impossible to watch due to BT broadband dropping out four times! OK so we give finally give up on the football after multiple times of re-connecting and also attempting to contact BT (impossible). Finally we get back on-line after going through the text instructions from BT. So we now tune get into a series on Netflix and STOP; the BT broadband goes down again and again until we finally give up. I would be ok with such as poor service if it were not for the £79 per month that I am begin charged for what BT advertise as the best super fast broadband available. The day I cancel my contract cant come soon enough! JH"
"No idea why so many negatives.... People just love to moan I suppose.... When you've lived without Internet in violent, poverty stricken countries it's amazing how selfish, pampered and complaining the west is.I ordered BT, was given a date of switchover, promised a new phone and router for said date and the transfere was flawless, on date specified, beautiful new digital phone with free 700 mins to mobiles and landlines a month, well cheaper than last network and so far no problems at all... Great signal and staff have been brilliant.Thankyou BT 👏👏"
"We have been without broadband for a month, unfortunately I have never dealt with such a disorganised shambles of a company, broken promises and no chance of ever speaking to a manager,£5 per day compensation what a joke, do not use these cowboys"
"I called at 20.51 today regarding 2 issues. The person who answered my first queery was rude as he ""sighed"" whist I was trying to explain my concern. I didn't even get to explain my other concern. I hope the call was recorded for training purposes!!"
"I contacted BT to cancel my contract as I got better deals elsewhere and their bills have become ridiculous for what they are providing. I've been with them for five years. I spoke to two very rude ladies in the retentions team who weren't forthcoming with the dates I wanted for me to confidently proceed with the cancellation. One of them was even audacious enough to ask which provider I was moving to. When I refused to give that information she got very ansie.Update: I can see there’s been a reply from BT. This person who has replied has failed to understand that I’m not looking for any offers from BT. He’s failed to understand that I want to  looking to leave them, just like the two rude ladies I spoke to.So I just contacted BT just to clarify the cancellation policy and they said it's a 30 day notice period. Essentially I could have started cancellation process two days ago if the silly people on the phone were not messing me about."
"My elderly mother in law has recently moved home to be closer to family after the passing of my father in law. I tried to arrange the transfer of her her phone line to the new address and also set up an internet account for her. I was told an engineer would call to do a survey of the premises prior to any installation date being given.  Three weeks ago the engineer arrived did what ever he had to do told me everything was good to go and left. I then got an installation date from BT of the 2nd May. An engineer arrive as arranged, but told us that he could not carry out the installation because there was no  box fitted to the outside of the house. Surely the first guy who called should have picked this up as he was there to make sure all was good to go prior to the install. I called BT to find out when the install would now be carried out and got no help what so ever, just the usual dribble and apologies, then passed on to another department who were equally unhelpful. I explained that  my mother in law is in her 80s and urgently needs a phone due to her ill health in case of emergencies. I was told yes I understand that but I still cant give you a date but will be in touch probably the next day with a new date. No one has contacted me either by phone or e mail since. Looks like another company could be getting a new customer soon. BT are all promises and apologies but are useless at following these promises up. It's like they tell you what you want to hear just to get rid of you."
"Been paying between 40 to 50 last 3 years, and suddenly jump to 60.00 absolute F****g scam. Gave 3 year’s service for nothing, tried to offer me a 75p discount F****g joke.Can get faster broadband for 30.00 for 18months bargain BT ABSOLUTELY 400.00 exit fee F****g joke again."
"Had a ton of frustrations with my business acc, but Puneet Nagpal turned a oner into a fiver. Thanks Puneet!"
"I can only say about the assistance I had from leaving Virgin Media and joining Bt.  I was put in touch with Has from the Manchester office.  All I can say is he has assisted me throughout the move consistently and promptly responded to any query I had, he was helpful, clear and gave me accurate information.  Nice one Has….  Very person centred individual, need more representatives like you. Thank You!"
I contacted BT as I was unhappy with the cost of the package and Ian got in touch today and has sorted it to a more manageable amount.Thank you Ian for a quick and efficient service
"I upgrade my home BT broadband last month and booked a date on the 27th of April for the engineer to come to install it, and also I got a confirmation email from BT that engineer will come today, I've been waiting at home all day but no one came... Because of this broadband, I asked for a day off from my work, and now I just lost a day's wages."
BT useless at communicationsI stopped using BT about five years ago because they were useless at communications. God only knows why I gave them a second chance..they have got worse. If you have any other option than BT take it and save yourself hours of wasted time talking with some off-short helpline that is clueless.
"Been a customer for 10 years and service was expensive but pretty good, but they have really let us down over our house move. We gave them plenty of notice that our move date had been pushed back by two weeks, but while they delayed the activation at the new address they didn’t postpone the disconnection so we are stuck with a crappy mini hub for two weeks that they insist should be adequate but won’t actually estimate a speed for. Wherever I put it, the speed is lousy and the connection keeps cutting out. They tell me it would take 10-14 days to reactivate the connection at our current address and would delay the reconnection by at least as long as that (which is probably code for it’s too much trouble for us, or our systems are too unreliable to expect them to ever work again if you do anything non-standard) so we are stuck with this rubbish for at least two weeks. I asked if I could end my contract with them without penalty as they have broken our contract by not providing the service we were promised and was told that I can’t, so we are stuck with them until renewal but we will never use them again after that."
"I have been a customer of BT’s for 30 years what a mistake. Their customer service must be the worst of any large companies I deal with. Have had an ongoing complaint open since the 22/2/23, on numerous occasions since then I have been promised a phone call from a manager to discuss my complaint. Has anybody phoned me NO !!! How when you phone up they have the nerve to play a recorded message saying they take pride in their customer service. Yesterday I received an email out of the blue, after no discussion to say my complaint had now been closed. What p..s poor customer service."
"If the option existed I would not give BT a single star.To make a complaint about ""under hand selling"" one has to write and post a letter.  BT choose to respond by email when one writes a second letter re-stating the original complaint.  No reply by email to the email is enabled by BT.  Instead, BT give a response that fails to evidence any investigation has been even started and close the complaint 4 hours later.Dismissive, uncaring, wholly lacking in any transparency or accountability.  How bad does it need to get before BT is broken up?The reply below is plain wrong.  1. It is simply impossible to communicate with BT by email.  There is no function on the web site to start a complaint this way nor is it possible to reply to an email sent by BT by way of a response.2.  When phoning BT to progress a complaint it is simply no access to a case worker.  Tellingly there is no option on the phone number provided to speak with anybody concerned with customer service.  The number provided privatises sales and upgrades.   So, when one does speak to somebody they have no clue about the complaint’s process so one starts agin, they refuse to share any contact details of those that do, and they provide fake links to the BT website for recordings of the call which do not work3.  The complaint process’s fragility is such that it fails to provide an audit trail.  The result is a complete failure to perform as there is no transparency nor accountability.I have now raised a case with The Ombudsman (c/o OFCOM)  and expect to be out of contract (phew!) by the time they get round to my case given the mountain they need to process ahead of me in the queue.I had no idea before coming on Trustpilot there would be so many negative reviews. There is clearly a pattern.  BT management are simply more concerned with locking in customers on long term contracts, jacking up prices, and making profits rather than competing fairly on customer service."
"Awful, I was a BT customer for many years, I moved homes and they stated that I could either cancel and get a new contract or move my existing contract across without extending my current term. I decided to move it across without expending the term i asked for confirmation of this multiple times and it was given verbally and apparently sent to me on an email which I never received. I recently cancelled my internet after around 15 months of being in this new property (39 months of having BT) as it just isn't value for money. As part of my cancellation I was charged £150 early cancellation fee which i rang up to contest and they apparently couldn't do anything about it as it wasn't 'billed' yet. I wait a bit and next thing you know Advantis debt collection letters are coming through the door as BT have sold on the Debt  as they know it shouldn't have been charged. They have the customer service of what I remember from EE which is ironic as they are now the same company. I wont got back to BT or EE I advise you don't accept this subpar monopoly either. Bring on the space based internet."
"I've been a customer of BT for 14 years and here's my review. Overall their broadband/mobile etc is good but I have decided to leave them when my contract ends due to the constant price increases. I have just received my new bill after their April increase and I will be paying £27 a month extra for exactly the same thing which is just a bit to much to swallow, especially as I can get the same service for half the price elsewhere. I was expecting the increase as its in my contract but that is taking the mick."
"You could not make this up!! BT took our phoneline away while we were on holiday in March!! They admitted it was their fault and agreed to pay me an amount, but because it was a lot!!(less then £180) had to be in 2 payments!! March 2023(payment 1) payment 2, March 2024!!Then our phone number that we have had for 41 years, BT decided to disconnect and 28th April new phoneline. New number, they didn't inform of of this new number!!  The area code is nowhere near where we live so when we tell people the new number, they get the response( out of area!!). Really, that included my husband sat at home ringing the phone, behind the TV he was watching!! To add 'Insult to injury' you then get a response that is from BT!! to contact them on Facebook or Twitter!!I have got a list of 25 complaints and would REALLY like a SENIOR Manager to contact me via email or mobile!! Your Customer Service people in many places are brilliant. Multiple apologies from them, not good enough. This is the start of my complaint."
"Called today to discuss the 25% increase on my monthly payments. Spoke to Luke, an experience so poor that it makes me want to switch immediately.In three years my monthly payment has jumped from £43 to £79 for the same package. Existing customers pay £50 for broadband that is £30 for new BT customers - and even less with other suppliers."
"Every time I talk to someone, they promise me one thing and then the bill says something else. Must be the worst customer service I have experienced. Being on to them all day, you think its all sorted and then you check your online bill and its gone up again with no relation to what you agreed. Don't go near BT. Wish I could give a zero. I think their CEO Philip Jansen’s has an  remuneration package of £3.5million. Disgraceful"
"On my first contract with BT I had several problems getting the broadband set up and it took 1 month+ extra. BT paid compensation for their poor service.I've just moved home and thought I'd continue with BT for ease. It's now 1 month+ in the new house with no internet as BT keep telling me ""it should be on by midnight"". I've heard this 4 times now....Update: 05/05, BT promised me fibre 2 with speeds of 68mbps guaranteed but I'm getting 12-20mbps. I have a complaint that is 9 days old and no one has spoken with me. I was told a manager would call me back within hours. BT make Three mobiles customer service look good!"
"Just left BT after about 15 years of being a loyal. Fibre broadband was promised back in 2013 and after ten years still being told not planned for your area and the ridiculous amount I was paying for home phone, mobile and internet. Speeds so slow for broadband. Home phone with noise interference. Mobile signal becoming worse with mobile broadband intermittent. I have now moved to another company and I no longer watch the circle wirring or just does not do anything. The BT staff I had spoken to did assist me the best they could but even they had to admit they could not improve things. I was paying about £80 for all three I now pay less than £58 for a much better service. BT needs to make some serious changes for me to ever consider coming back."
BT Halo 3 is simply a con. BT's Full Fibre promise is hollow. This package promises full fibre as soon as it is available at your property. This is a lie. Once a company that doesn't rely on Open Reach installs full fibre then BT don't bother but continue to charge for this service anyway. BT are rogue traders.
"Useless broadband service, endless faults meaning ages whilst BT deal wil ' high call volumes' i.e low staff volumes.Wrong engineer sent out repeatedly. Terrible service"
Terrible company to say the least. Lived in a maisonette and had no issues for year with BT. I moved to a house at the start of April and called to move over my Wi-Fi and was offered the halo package for £45 thinking that’s an awesome deal. Nothing was mentioned of change of speeds or anything like that so the engineer came out and hooked up the Wi-Fi and everything seemed good to go. I then noticed my speeds coming back at 22 Mbps so I gave them a call and they then sent out an engineer to find that in my area speeds can’t go above that. They tried to charge me the same price for 70 Mbps that I previously had and said oh that might be the quickest speeds in the area which makes no sense because you still aren’t getting what you pay for? I told them I refused to pay £45 for a package that was offered to me without all the terms first and that £45 was not worth 22 Mbps. At first they told me there was nothing they could do and after an hour and 20 mins on the phone they moved me over to EE for the same package for £24 but just without the booster discs which is not needed for Wi-Fi so low since you can’t run games on this speed anyway. I felt humiliated that they had sent out an engineer for absolutely no reason and wasted mine and his time when the engineer himself told me that they could’ve done the same speeds there and then. They then told me I would have Wi-Fi until the date my EE broadband would be switched on to then find this morning that my internet no longer works. Avoid this company at all costs. It should not have taken an hour and 20 mins to be sorted and they should be making their customers well aware of what they’re actually paying for. Although I will say the guy that helped me switch over to EE was lovely and managed to help sort the situation quicker than the last 2 that constantly kept telling me there was nothing they could do.
"Rang BT ,  if I was a new customer I would be able to get my monthly payments reduced by half.Granted things are going up but when you have been with them for 22 years after finding out my monthly payment has gone up by £ 15 ,  person I spoke to didn’t what to know or look into my account ,  it was tuff I am looking into another provider"
"BT are a disgusting company by their new price rise of over 14% at a time when people are struggling and are stuck in the contract.We have been with BT for around 5 years now.I believe they have just killed their own company off, as I for one will never sign a new contract with them in the future and every single person that I have spoke to have said the same.Bye bye BT, let's see how many customers you loose over this."
"I have been having constant issues with my internet connection with BT Broadband. So far I have had two engineers from Open Reach come out to sort out the problem in the last ten days. The BT test; says that my Broadband is slow, the tv is on the internet, so films constantly buffer !! I have contacted BT via the ""return my call"" twice in the last two days, but as yet I am still waiting. Well, if they dont fix it soon their be ""waiting"" for me to pay the bill. Currently £79.00 a month for this not so teriffic service. SO BT get your act together and get my Broadband sorted out. It worked before, why wont it NOW ??"
"I have never written a review before but thought I had to in this case. I want to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the level of service I have received from BT. I am a new customer and my recent experiences have left me feeling extremely dissatisfied with the company.  Firstly, I would like to highlight the shocking level of customer service that I have encountered. I have made numerous calls to your customer service team, but on each occasion, I have been met with unhelpful and rude representatives who have provided me with no resolution to my queries. Furthermore, I have been misled on several occasions regarding the products I have purchased. I have been promised a certain level of service, which has not been delivered, leaving me feeling cheated and disappointed.  In addition, I have had multiple appointments cancelled by BT at the last minute, which has caused significant inconvenience to my schedule and wasted my valuable time.  Lastly, I have found the management team to be completely unresponsive to my concerns and complaints. Despite numerous attempts to escalate my issues, I have received no satisfactory response or resolution.  I expect more from a company that claims to provide excellent customer service and I am deeply disappointed in the level of service I have received from BT. If I could put no stars I would. Six weeks on and no internet and no sign of any resolution. Manager I spoke to wouldn’t give his name and the way he spoke to me was utterly disrespectful and disgusting."
After being a loyal BT customer for 30 years I was shocked they took advantage of this. Year on year I would renew my broadband package at inflated prices and really slow speeds. No more I’m going  to change after this contract finishes.
"I have closed my bt account and opened a new account in my wifes name, new email, new password, new pin number. Get emails saying monthly bills, but try to log on to the account, keeps saying wrong information. Tried all the options to recover or change and every time draws a blank and not accepting me.I have the account number, the phone number, there is no way to contact a actual person."
Absolute waste of time. Waited weeks to get fibre connection and egineer turns up and says he only does copper connection. Contacted BT and they said it was my fault the wrong internet was ordered. Didn't know I was a manager of BT now.In response to your message why do I have to waste more time to rearrange this? You should be reaching out to me to resolve this. I have wasted nearly a month to get this ordered and now wasting time again. You are treating people like mugs
